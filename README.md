# RISC-V-CPU-CORE-
1. Executive SummaryThe RISC-V Origami Core is a 32-bit, single-cycle processor based on the RV32I instruction set architecture. Unlike standard academic implementations, this core prioritizes Area Optimization and Dynamic Power Reduction. It employs "Logic Folding" to minimize Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) gate count and Integrated Clock Gating (ICG) to eliminate redundant switching power in the Register File.2. Architectural InnovationsA. Logic Folding ("Origami" ALU)Standard ALUs often instantiate separate hardware blocks for Addition (+), Subtraction (-), and Comparison (<). This leads to redundant silicon usage.Technique: The "Origami" technique folds these operations into a single 32-bit Adder.Implementation: The ALU utilizes 2's Complement arithmetic logic.Addition: $A + B$Subtraction: $A + (\sim B) + 1$Set Less Than (SLT): Performs subtraction and checks the Most Significant Bit (Sign Bit) of the result.Code Reference: In ALU_FOLDED, the carry_in and operand_b_inv signals dynamically reconfigure the hardware adder based on the alu_control signal, effectively "folding" three distinct operations into one hardware block.B. Integrated Clock Gating (ICG)In digital circuits, the clock tree consumes the majority of dynamic power ($P_{dynamic} = \alpha C V^2 f$).Technique: Instead of enabling the write-logic via a multiplexer (which keeps the clock toggling internally), this design physically suppresses the clock signal entering the Register File when regwrite_en is low.Glitch-Free Logic: The CLOCK_GATING_CELL module implements a Latch-based AND gate.Why a Latch? A simple AND gate can produce dangerous voltage glitches (spikes) if the enable signal changes while the clock is high. The low-level latch ensures the enable signal is stable before the clock rises, guaranteeing a clean clock pulse.Result: When the processor executes Branch, Store, or NOP instructions, the Register File consumes near-zero dynamic power.3. Module Hierarchy & Data FlowIFU (Instruction Fetch Unit):Contains the Program Counter (PC) and INST_MEM.Increments PC by 4 bytes on every clock cycle to fetch the next 32-bit instruction.Memory: Implemented as a byte-addressable array using Little-Endian fetch logic.CONTROL_UNIT (Decoder):Pure combinational logic.Latch-Free Design: Utilizes "Default Assignment" coding style (regwrite_en = 0 at the top of the block) to prevent the synthesis tool from inferring unintentional latches, ensuring timing stability.REG_FILE_GATED:Standard RISC-V configuration: 32 registers (x0–x31).x0 Hardwiring: Register x0 is hardwired to return 0 strictly, regardless of write attempts.Clock Interface: Receives the gated clock from the ICG cell rather than the raw system clock.ALU_FOLDED:Executes arithmetic, logical, and shift operations.Generates the Zero Flag used for branch decision logic (future extensibility).4. Synthesis & Verification NotesStandard: IEEE 1364-2001 Verilog.Simulation: The provided TB_RISCV_ORIGAMI testbench initializes the processor, asserts a synchronous reset, and monitors the instruction flow.Waveform Analysis: The testbench generates a .vcd (Value Change Dump) file. In the waveform, you will observe PC incrementing and the ALU Result updating only on valid operations, while the gated_clock inside the Register File will remain flat during non-write cycles.
